      A: RECAST consists of a textbox and a radial progress bar. A color change on the radial progress, along with a score, indicate the toxicity of a sentence. 
Toxicity ranges from white (non-toxic) to red (very toxic). Users can hover over options to preview toxicity scores for replacing the selected word in the sentence. 
B: upon replacing the word (in the case of this figure, replacing “idiotic” with “nonsensical”), the main radial progress bar reflects the reduced toxicity score. 
However the small attention on the other pejorative word &quot;moron&quot; compared to &quot;video&quot; in the alternative version shows the idiosyncrasies of the model and underlying dataset.


    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As toxic language becomes nearly pervasive online, there has been increasing interest in leveraging the advancements in natural language processing (NLP) to automatically detect and remove toxic comments. 
Despite fairness concerns and limited interpretability, there is currently little work for auditing these systems in particular for end users. 
We present our ongoing work, RECAST, an interactive tool for auditing toxicity detection models by visualizing explanations for predictions and providing alternative wordings for detected toxic speech. 
RECAST displays the attention of toxicity detection models on user input, and provides an intuitive system for rewording impactful language within a comment with less toxic alternative words close in embedding space. 
Finally we propose a larger user study  of RECAST, with promising preliminary results, to validate it’s effectiveness and useability with end users.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption class=&quot;single&quot;&gt;
      FairVis integrates multiple coordinated views for discovering intersectional bias. 
Above, our user investigates the intersectional subgroups of &lt;i&gt;sex&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;race&lt;/i&gt;. 
A. The Feature Distribution View allows users to visualize each feature's distribution and generate subgroups.
B. The Subgroup Overview lets users select various fairness metrics to see the global average per metric and compare subgroups to one another, e.g., pinned Caucasian Males versus hovered African-American Males.
The plots for &lt;i&gt;Recall&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;False Positive Rate&lt;/i&gt; show that for African-American Males, the model has relatively high recall but also the highest false positive rate out of all subgroups of sex and race. 
C. The Detailed Comparison View lets users compare the details of two groups and investigate their class balances.
Since the difference in False Positive Rates between Caucasian Males and African-American Males is far larger than their difference in base rates, a user suspects this part of the model merits further inquiry. 
D. The Suggested and Similar Subgroup View shows suggested subgroups ranked by the worst performance in a given metric. 


    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growing capability and accessibility of machine learning has led to its application to many real-world domains and data about people.
Despite the benefits algorithmic systems may bring, models can reflect, inject, or exacerbate implicit and explicit societal biases into their outputs, disadvantaging certain demographic subgroups.
Discovering which biases a machine learning model has introduced is a great challenge, due to the numerous definitions of fairness and the large number of potentially impacted subgroups.
We present FairVis, a mixed-initiative visual analytics system that integrates a novel subgroup discovery technique for users to audit the fairness of machine learning models.
Through FairVis, users can apply domain knowledge to generate and investigate known subgroups, and explore suggested and similar subgroups.
FairVis’ coordinated views enable users to explore a high-level overview of subgroup performance and subsequently drill down into detailed investigation of specific subgroups.
We show how FairVis helps to discover biases in two real datasets used in predicting income and recidivism.
As a visual analytics system devoted to discovering bias in machine learning, FairVis demonstrates how interactive visualization may help data scientists and the general public understand and create more equitable algorithmic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
