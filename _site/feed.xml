      Cross-linguistic comparison of bias scores in ambiguous prompts. Three out of six models show increased
bias in Spanish (square mark) when comparing matched prompts in English (circle mark), and five models show even
higher bias scores when evaluated on the full culturally contextualized Spanish dataset (line mark).


    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper addresses the critical gap in evaluating bias
in multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs), with a
specific focus on Spanish language within culturally-aware
Latin American contexts. Despite widespread global deployment, current evaluations remain predominantly US-English-
centric, leaving potential harms in other linguistic and cultural contexts largely underexamined. We introduce a novel,
culturally-grounded framework for detecting social biases in instruction-tuned LLMs. Our approach adapts the 
underspecified question methodology from the BBQ dataset by incorporating culturally-specific expressions and sayings that 
encode regional stereotypes across four social categories: gender, race, socioeconomic class, and national origin. 
Using more than 4,000 prompts, we propose a new metric that combines accuracy with the direction of error to effectively 
balance model performance and bias alignment in both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. To our knowledge, our work
presents the first systematic evaluation examining how leading commercial LLMs respond to culturally specific bias in
the Spanish language, revealing varying patterns of bias manifestation across state-of-the-art models. We also contribute
evidence that bias mitigation techniques optimized for English do not effectively transfer to Spanish tasks, and that
bias patterns remain largely consistent across different sampling temperatures. Our modular framework offers a natural
extension to new stereotypes, bias categories, or languages and cultural contexts, representing a significant step toward
more equitable and culturally-aware evaluation of AI systems in the diverse linguistic environments where they operate.&lt;/p&gt;

      We propose a new framework for approximate DP auditing using e-values, non-negative random variables that 
(when multiplied) sequentially accumulate evidence against the null hypothesis. Under the null H0, the expectation 
of an e-value is bounded by 1; under the alternative H1, well-designed (products of) e-values can grow exponentially fast, 
allowing for early stopping and efficient detection of privacy violations. This sequential methodology allows testing to
proceed adaptively: samples are collected and evaluated iteratively, and the test stops as soon as a significance level α is reached

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose a practical sequential test for auditing differential privacy guarantees
of black-box mechanisms. The test processes streams of mechanisms’ outputs
providing anytime-valid inference while controlling Type I error, overcoming the
fixed sample size limitation of previous batch auditing methods. Experiments
show this test detects violations with sample sizes that are orders of magnitude
smaller than existing methods, reducing this number from 50K to a few hundred
examples, across diverse realistic mechanisms. Notably, it identifies DP-SGD
privacy violations in under one training run, unlike prior methods needing full
model training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We propose Conformal Mixed-Integer Constraint Learning (C-MICL), a novel framework
that provides probabilistic feasibility guarantees for data-driven constraints in optimization
problems. While standard Mixed-Integer Constraint Learning methods often violate the
true constraints due to model error or data limitations, our C-MICL approach leverages
conformal prediction to ensure feasible solutions are ground-truth feasible. This guarantee
holds with probability at least 1−α, under a conditional independence assumption. The
proposed framework supports both regression and classification tasks without requiring
access to the true constraint function, while avoiding the scalability issues associated with
ensemble-based heuristics. Experiments on real-world applications demonstrate that C-MICL
consistently achieves target feasibility rates, maintains competitive objective performance,
and significantly reduces computational cost compared to existing methods. Our work
bridges mathematical optimization and machine learning, offering a principled approach
to incorporate uncertainty-aware constraints into decision-making with rigorous statistical guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We contribute a general and flexible framework to estimate the size of a closed population in the presence of 
K capture-recapture lists and heterogeneous capture probabilities.
Our novel identifying strategy leverages the fact that it is sufficient for identification that
a subset of the K lists are not arbitrarily dependent within the subset of the population
unobserved by the remaining lists, conditional on covariates. This identification approach
is interpretable and actionable, interpolating between the two predominant approaches in
the literature as special cases: (conditional) independence across lists and log-linear models
with no highest-order interaction. We derive nonparametric doubly-robust estimators for
the resulting identification expression that are nearly optimal and approximately normal
for any finite sample size, even when the heterogeneous capture probabilities are estimated
nonparametrically using machine learning methods. Additionally, we devise a sensitivity
analysis to show how deviations from the identification assumptions affect the resulting
population size estimates, allowing for the integration of domain-specific knowledge into
the identification and estimation processes more transparently. We empirically demonstrate
the advantages of our method using both synthetic data and real data from the Peruvian
internal armed conflict to estimate the number of casualties. The proposed methodology
addresses recent critiques of capture-recapture models by allowing for a weaker and more
interpretable identifying assumption and accommodating complex heterogeneous capture
probabilities depending on high-dimensional or continuous covariates.&lt;/p&gt;

Current non-technical surveys (grey) are based on the visual inspection of data in geospatial information systems and human expert analyses including local community surveys and domain knowledge.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landmines remain a threat to war-affected communities for years after conflicts have ended, partly due to the laborious
nature of demining tasks. Humanitarian demining operations begin by collecting relevant information from the sites to be
cleared, which is then analyzed by human experts to determine the potential risk of remaining landmines. In this paper, we
propose RELand system to support these tasks, which consists of three major components. We (1) provide general feature
engineering and label assigning guidelines to enhance datasets for landmine risk modeling, which are widely applicable
to global demining routines, (2) formulate landmine presence as a classification problem and design a novel interpretable
model based on sparse feature masking and invariant risk minimization, and run extensive evaluation under proper protocols
that resemble real-world demining operations to show a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art, and (3) build
an interactive web interface to suggest priority areas for demining organizations. We are currently collaborating with a
humanitarian demining NGO in Colombia that is using our system as part of their field operations in two areas recently
prioritized for demining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The causal link between victimization and violence later in life is largely
accepted but has been understudied for victimized adolescents. In this work
we use the Add Health dataset, the largest nationally representative longitudinal survey of adolescents, to estimate the relationship between victimization and future offending in this population. To accomplish this, we derive a
new doubly robust estimator for the average treatment effect on the treated
(ATT) when the treatment and outcome are not always observed. We then
find that the offending rate among victimized individuals would have been
3.86 percentage points lower if none of them had been victimized (95% CI:
[0.28, 7.45]). This contributes positive evidence of a causal effect of victimization on future offending among adolescents. We further present statistical
evidence of heterogeneous effects by age, under which the ATT decreases
according to the age at which victimization is experienced. We then devise
a novel risk-ratio-based sensitivity analysis and conclude that our results are
robust to modest unmeasured confounding. Finally, we show that the found
effect is mainly driven by non-violent offending.&lt;/p&gt;

How should researchers assess whether the AI actually improved outcomes? Randomized experiments are the gold standard for evaluation. They enable one to isolate the effect of the AI from other 
potentially confounding factors. Examples of AI systems for social impact that have been deployed and evaluated in the real world abound: Wang et al. [2019] studies the effect on the adenoma detection 
rate of using real-time AI-assisted colonoscopies, Mohler et al. [2015] evaluates the effect of using a predictive policing model on crime rates in Los Angeles, Mate et al. [2021] assesses the effect 
on dropout of using a model to prioritize the follow-up of participants in a maternal and child care information program, etc. In this chapter we give an introduction and review of randomized experiments.
