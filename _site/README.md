## Install
First time running ruby or jekyll on mac requires separate ruby install from built in version. If not done correctly can lead to permission write errors. See [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51126403/you-dont-have-write-permissions-for-the-library-ruby-gems-2-3-0-directory-ma) about getting Ruby and bundler set up.

To install packages for this project run:
```bash
bundle install
```

## Run
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
