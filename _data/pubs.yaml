     Estimated number of casualties in the Peruvian internal conflict for different identification strategies vs. 
     positivity lower bound on the estimated q-probabilities.
  abstract: |
    We contribute a general and flexible framework to estimate the size of a closed population in the presence of 
    K capture-recapture lists and heterogeneous capture probabilities.
    Our novel identifying strategy leverages the fact that it is sufficient for identification that
    a subset of the K lists are not arbitrarily dependent within the subset of the population
    unobserved by the remaining lists, conditional on covariates. This identification approach
    is interpretable and actionable, interpolating between the two predominant approaches in
    the literature as special cases: (conditional) independence across lists and log-linear models
    with no highest-order interaction. We derive nonparametric doubly-robust estimators for
    the resulting identification expression that are nearly optimal and approximately normal
    for any finite sample size, even when the heterogeneous capture probabilities are estimated
    nonparametrically using machine learning methods. Additionally, we devise a sensitivity
    analysis to show how deviations from the identification assumptions affect the resulting
    population size estimates, allowing for the integration of domain-specific knowledge into
    the identification and estimation processes more transparently. We empirically demonstrate
    the advantages of our method using both synthetic data and real data from the Peruvian
    internal armed conflict to estimate the number of casualties. The proposed methodology
    addresses recent critiques of capture-recapture models by allowing for a weaker and more
    interpretable identifying assumption and accommodating complex heterogeneous capture
    probabilities depending on high-dimensional or continuous covariates.

  feature-title: "RELand: Risk Estimation of Landmines via Interpretable Invariant Risk Minimization"
  summary: "ML system to support humanitarian demining, currently being tested in Colombia."
  caption: "Integration of RELand system into the humanitarian demining pipeline. Current non-technical surveys (grey)
    are based on the visual inspection of data in geospatial information systems and human expert analyses including local
    community surveys and domain knowledge. RELand (yellow dashed box) serves as an additional toolbox that contains three
    major components: dataset enhancement based on existing public geospatial datasets (red), risk modeling with machine
    learning methods (blue), and interactive web interface (green)."
  abstract: |
    Landmines remain a threat to war-affected communities for years after conflicts have ended, partly due to the laborious
    nature of demining tasks. Humanitarian demining operations begin by collecting relevant information from the sites to be
    cleared, which is then analyzed by human experts to determine the potential risk of remaining landmines. In this paper, we
    propose RELand system to support these tasks, which consists of three major components. We (1) provide general feature
    engineering and label assigning guidelines to enhance datasets for landmine risk modeling, which are widely applicable
    to global demining routines, (2) formulate landmine presence as a classification problem and design a novel interpretable
    model based on sparse feature masking and invariant risk minimization, and run extensive evaluation under proper protocols
    that resemble real-world demining operations to show a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art, and (3) build
    an interactive web interface to suggest priority areas for demining organizations. We are currently collaborating with a
    humanitarian demining NGO in Colombia that is using our system as part of their field operations in two areas recently
    prioritized for demining.

    Heterogeneous ATT of victimization on future offending by age at the victimizing event using doubly robust estimators.
  abstract: |
    The causal link between victimization and violence later in life is largely
    accepted but has been understudied for victimized adolescents. In this work
    we use the Add Health dataset, the largest nationally representative longitudinal survey of adolescents, to estimate the relationship between victimization and future offending in this population. To accomplish this, we derive a
    new doubly robust estimator for the average treatment effect on the treated
    (ATT) when the treatment and outcome are not always observed. We then
    find that the offending rate among victimized individuals would have been
    3.86 percentage points lower if none of them had been victimized (95% CI:
    [0.28, 7.45]). This contributes positive evidence of a causal effect of victimization on future offending among adolescents. We further present statistical
    evidence of heterogeneous effects by age, under which the ATT decreases
    according to the age at which victimization is experienced. We then devise
    a novel risk-ratio-based sensitivity analysis and conclude that our results are
    robust to modest unmeasured confounding. Finally, we show that the found
    effect is mainly driven by non-violent offending.

  abstract: |
    Once deployed in the real world, even the most carefully designed artificial intelligence (AI) systems may fail to achieve their intended goals or may have adverse unintended consequences. 
    How should researchers assess whether the AI actually improved outcomes? Randomized experiments are the gold standard for evaluation. They enable one to isolate the effect of the AI from other 
    potentially confounding factors. Examples of AI systems for social impact that have been deployed and evaluated in the real world abound: Wang et al. [2019] studies the effect on the adenoma detection 
    rate of using real-time AI-assisted colonoscopies, Mohler et al. [2015] evaluates the effect of using a predictive policing model on crime rates in Los Angeles, Mate et al. [2021] assesses the effect 
    on dropout of using a model to prioritize the follow-up of participants in a maternal and child care information program, etc. In this chapter we give an introduction and review of randomized experiments. 
    More details and exposition can be found in Hernán and Robins [2010], Imbens and Rubin [2015], Rosenbaum [2002], Tsiatis [2006], van der Laan and Robins [2003], for example, among many others.
