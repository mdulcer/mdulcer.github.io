  feature-title: Reuse and Sharing in Data Science
  feature-description: "Interviews and a survey with 149 data scientists at Microsoft revealed five distinct strategies for sharing and reusing analysis code along with factors that encourage or discourage reuse."
  summary: "We conducted interviews and a survey with 149 data scientists at Microsoft and describe five distinct strategies for sharing and reusing analysis code at the personal and team level. The iterative, exploratory nature of data science distinguishes these strategies from traditional software engineering and creates different incentives for reuse."
