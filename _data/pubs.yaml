  feature-title: "RELand: Risk Estimation of Landmines via Interpretable Invariant Risk Minimization"
  summary: "ML system to support humanitarian demining, currently being tested in Colombia."
  caption: "Integration of RELand system into the humanitarian demining pipeline. Current non-technical surveys (grey)
    are based on the visual inspection of data in geospatial information systems and human expert analyses including local
    community surveys and domain knowledge. RELand (yellow dashed box) serves as an additional toolbox that contains three
    major components: dataset enhancement based on existing public geospatial datasets (red), risk modeling with machine
    learning methods (blue), and interactive web interface (green)."
  abstract: |
    Landmines remain a threat to war-affected communities for years after conflicts have ended, partly due to the laborious
    nature of demining tasks. Humanitarian demining operations begin by collecting relevant information from the sites to be
    cleared, which is then analyzed by human experts to determine the potential risk of remaining landmines. In this paper, we
    propose RELand system to support these tasks, which consists of three major components. We (1) provide general feature
    engineering and label assigning guidelines to enhance datasets for landmine risk modeling, which are widely applicable
    to global demining routines, (2) formulate landmine presence as a classification problem and design a novel interpretable
    model based on sparse feature masking and invariant risk minimization, and run extensive evaluation under proper protocols
    that resemble real-world demining operations to show a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art, and (3) build
    an interactive web interface to suggest priority areas for demining organizations. We are currently collaborating with a
    humanitarian demining NGO in Colombia that is using our system as part of their field operations in two areas recently
    prioritized for demining.

    Despite their ubiquity, authoring dashboards for metrics reporting in modern data analysis tools remains a manual, time-consuming process. 
    Rather than focusing on interesting combinations of their data, users have to spend time creating each chart in a dashboard one by one. 
    This makes dashboard creation slow and tedious. We conducted a review of production metrics dashboards and found that many dashboards contain a 
    common structure: breaking down one or more metrics by different dimensions. In response, we developed a high-level specification for describing 
    dashboards as sections of metrics repeated across the same dimensions and a graphical interface, Quick Dashboard, for authoring dashboards based on 
    this specification. We present several usage examples that demonstrate the flexibility of this specification to create various kinds of dashboards 
    and support a data-first approach to dashboard authoring.

    Heterogeneous ATT of victimization on future offending by age at the victimizing event using doubly robust estimators.
  abstract: |
    The causal link between victimization and violence later in life is largely
    accepted but has been understudied for victimized adolescents. In this work
    we use the Add Health dataset, the largest nationally representative longitudinal survey of adolescents, to estimate the relationship between victimization and future offending in this population. To accomplish this, we derive a
    new doubly robust estimator for the average treatment effect on the treated
    (ATT) when the treatment and outcome are not always observed. We then
    find that the offending rate among victimized individuals would have been
    3.86 percentage points lower if none of them had been victimized (95% CI:
    [0.28, 7.45]). This contributes positive evidence of a causal effect of victimization on future offending among adolescents. We further present statistical
    evidence of heterogeneous effects by age, under which the ATT decreases
    according to the age at which victimization is experienced. We then devise
    a novel risk-ratio-based sensitivity analysis and conclude that our results are
    robust to modest unmeasured confounding. Finally, we show that the found
    effect is mainly driven by non-violent offending.
